**Library Project Brief**

**Scenario** - A Library wants to improve their current quality analysis, as manually completing the tasks take too much time and is less reliable. They are looking for a more efficient way to filter data using Python and automation.

**User Stories**
As a libarian, I want a process to run automatically on a schedule so that quality checks are always up to date.
As a librarian, I want poor-quality or incomplete records to be automatically flagged so that I don't have to manually check thousands of entries.
As a library manager, I want to have the confidence in the accuracy of data and be able to view the quality analysis on a dashboard.
